b# Bachelor thesis template (NTNU)

A Latex template, class file, and examples for writing a bachelor thesis at NTNU

## Setting up

You can use the template with [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com), and you are strongly encouraged to do so. The alternative is to install local copy of LaTeX on your laptop (not adviced, huge, difficult, and you need to maintain it yourself).

There are two ways for setting up the [**Overleaf**](http://overleaf.com) project with the template:
* Use the .zip copy and upload
* Fork the the COPCSE repo so that you have your own files to edit.

You should **fork** the COPCSE repo so that you have your own files to edit and you can always merge with the upstream changes to the template, in case the template is updated. 

Use the [**video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/wfej8tQkFmY) to set yourself up with ShareLatex and the template. Should be similar procedure as with Overleaf.


## Using the template

You should not change anything in the ntnuthesis folder.  That contains the structure and style information.

You should edit the files in the inc\ folder.  You can also add files in the images\ folder.  The BachelorThesis.tex file should also be changed to include any other folders. 

To add personal information you need to edit:
```
inc/BachelorThesisData.tex
```
This is where the information for the front material is set.
