\subsection*{Minutes}

We have gotten our Supervisor back.
We are starting on the thesis writing and won't do much with the development. 
We have gotten some pointers on structure for writing. 

For the state of the program, we are having problems with merging files, at least in c++ as it is a compiler level statement and not included in the antlr.
