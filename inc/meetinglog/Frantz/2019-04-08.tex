\subsection*{Minutes}
For the last week we have been pair programming and gotten a lot of difficult tasks done. 
We should fix the problem where to many nameplates causing clutter. Could substitute clutters with number of nameplates or number of types. 

For setting up the thesis, we should structure it systematically like MDA (mechanics dynamics aesthetics), low level implementation or high level overview. We should also connect what we have done with the other subjects we have had.

We should think about delta-parsing but implement the "bigger fish to fry". 

We should talk about use of libraries vs standards. 

we should talk about complexity metrics and how this correlates with byte-code and not always source code/ face value.

For testing we can take names if they allow us to and quote them. 
We should allow for change in the rest api and give documentation by version.

We should talk about what we consider feature complete.
