We are still struggling with parsing functions, we have refactored from multiple conditionals to instead use listeners. We also try to debug by using reflection to find out what we have available and what it will return. 

At this point we can think about standardizing a middle layer to make it easier to add new languages later.

We are thinking to only parse one language from now as we have found that our approach would work for multiple languages without problem. If we continue with only one language from now we could focus on other aspects. 

The java grammar is very good and made by the one who made antlr and follow the specifications. 

We will still make as much as possible language independent.
