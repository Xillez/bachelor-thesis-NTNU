\subsection*{Minutes}
We have used a websocket witch is in conflict with the requirement for REST api.
REST api criteria has been loosened, the idea is to have it available at all times.

We found that figuring out what functions call what won't be trivial. It can contain nested structures recursively. We will be able to solve it, but it might take a long time to add this feature. We work on seperate tasks, but have a low threshold for getting help from other groupmembers. 

We should look into interpreter pattern. 

If we use external parties for quality metrics, then we need to make sure we can submit code snippets(function level) and not whole projects.
