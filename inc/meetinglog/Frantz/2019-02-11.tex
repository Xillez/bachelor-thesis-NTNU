\subsection*{Minutes}
As an opening, we estimate that we are 1 day behind.
response: Thats not a worry, there will be more like that. 

We had some problems with imgui, The functionality is there but the boxes are black. 
We should talk to Per Morten as he has experience with imgui, but not with js binding.

We had problems with antlr, it was made in java but has golang target but that is in development. We went with java version. 

We have set up the server, no testing yet and it took longer than expected. 

We will have problems that others don't as your project is entierly different from the other projects. Don't worry too much. 

next sprint will be "representation of complex datastructures". Seems good, don't get too discuraged if you can't make too complex structures. Would be nice with multilevel structures and trees. 


Not a fan of npm. Breaks often. Its a possibility but would prefer a lightweight option for important dependencies.
