    \item Feedback
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Minutes}
We have added a front page with description and supported browsers and current features handled. 
We have websocket finished and giving more info about status user.

Would be nice to make it possible to compare different repositories. Would be nice to be able to change between different repos and retain state. 
We need to consider memory at this point.

We will continue with function calls and class parsing. In addition we would like to represent the scopes on front end. In addition we have looked at connacence and cliometric, metrics. Found a related one for Halstead complexity measures. 

If we do user studies, we need to try to get around gdpr and have it offline. It would be difficult to go for the entirely formal approach requiring questions to be submitted and confirmed through a process taking over a month. 

We are worried about the complexity of figuring out functions as in c++ its tightly connected to the data.
