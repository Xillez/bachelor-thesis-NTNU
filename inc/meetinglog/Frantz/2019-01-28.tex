Its ok to say "you don't have webgl, good luck".
I would suggest you try to find out what the tricky parts are and chose your libraries around that.

I think it should be made future proof, so don't use angular. Could look into react native but the focus should be on the webgl part. Do the webgl part well and the rest is not important. You need systematic decisioning to show why you went for a framework/libraries.

For the first sprint use it for trying out different things and figuring out what works.
