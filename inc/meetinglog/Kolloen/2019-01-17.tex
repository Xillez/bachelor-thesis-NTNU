\subsection*{Minutes}

\subsubsection*{Feedback on report draft}

Not much to say, it is overall ok. Regarding the rutines you should add what will happen if rules are broken.
An example could be 3 days without working gives a warning before talking with me (supervisor). 

\subsubsection*{What should be the title of the development model and related topics?}
You don't need to use the original title, make a new one for yourself.

\subsubsection*{What should we do regarding the open task description? }
Discuss with the product owner, try to extract more information. Talk about what you expect should be the requirements and go from there.

\subsubsection*{What is the difference between subject area and background section?}
There is not much of a difference, what you got now seem to be ok.

\subsubsection*{What should we do with the effect and result goals?}
result goals is what you deliver on the last day whilst effect goals is the effect of the program in action after delivery. You won't have the chance to verify that it's effect are good enough. Don't set error message as a result goals as those are expected anyway.

\subsubsection*{Can we change the project plan during the development?}
Yes, try to make it as specific as possible now, but as you are using an agile development method, you should change it later. Might want to have a old and new version of the plan to compare at the end.

\subsection*{What should be added to the apendix?}
You should add meeting summary and time log but not things like commit log or change log.

\subsubsection*{What development method should we use with DevOps?}
That is up to you. Scrum, as you have mentioned, is a good idea but you should look at other alternatives to.

\subsubsection*{do we lack any group roles?}
You only lack those that are specific for the development method you chose.
