\subsection*{Preparation for Christopher meeting}

We need more concrete specifications for the task in order to write a good report. The problems mostly regard requirements and risks. We should make a drawing of how we see the system and confirm with him that our vision does not contradict his. Might want to mention how the nodes in the 3d view has gravity towards each other and towards meddle based on number of connections and connections to each other.

\subsection*{Preparation for Kolloen meeting}

I will be a short meeting as we talked with him on thursday.
We need to ask about the gant diagram as we are using scrum. The risk analysis should also be discussed.  

We still have to do task devision, plan for handling important risk and development plan. We should probably have done a bit of that before the meeting.

\subsection*{Other}

We should probably work more efficiently, we spend too much time talking.
